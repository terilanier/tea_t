							<p>For an Illustrator class, I recreated a brogue shoe in a realistic style. Taking the project further, the brogue became the launching point for a shoe retailer and product line: Savile Row Collection. The fictitious brand is an international retailer of fine clothing with a focus on menswear. Located in the Savile Row district of London since 1915, it has launched its own polish brand to reinforce a new collection of bespoke leather shoes, notable for saturated color options in traditional styles.</p>
							<p>The target audience is men age 40+ with an annual base income $100,000/ £77,000. The advertising challenge that is met in this campaign is to encourage a new generation of men to care for their luxury shoes, and to give traditional shoe care a modern makeover.</p>
							<span class="image portfolio"><h4>Brogue Illustration and Branding </h4><img src="images/fulls/darcy/01.jpg" alt="" /><br></br><h4> Poster Campaign</h4>
								<p> The challenge: Not many people keep leather care or shoe kits anymore. Keeping one's shoes looking sharp needs to be as enticing as the shoes. The solution: I created posters to remind the target audience that daily life has opportunities to distinguish oneself.

							<img src="images/fulls/darcy/02.jpg" alt="" /><br></br><h4>Web Ads</h4>
						<p>Using references from entertainment culture (James Bond and Firefly fandoms), these web ads utilize humor to connect with the target audience. The two-fold “Call to Action" is <em>Care for your shoes with our polish; distinguish yourself with our shoes.</em></p>
